# SQL_Practice

## Overview

Welcome to the SQL_Practice Repository! This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to SQL practice problems sourced from DataLemur. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn SQL or an experienced developer aiming to sharpen your skills, this repository offers structured practice exercises categorized by difficulty level.

## Introduction

The SQL practice problems in this repository are organized into three main folders based on difficulty levels:

- **Easy**: Entry-level SQL problems to get you started.
- **Medium**: Intermediate SQL challenges for expanding your SQL knowledge.
- **Hard**: Advanced SQL problems to test and refine your expertise.

Each folder contains:

- SQL script files (`*.sql`) presenting the problem statements.
- Corresponding SQL solution files (`*_solution.sql`) offering one or more solutions to each problem.

## Folder Structure

The repository structure is designed to facilitate easy navigation and practice:

```
